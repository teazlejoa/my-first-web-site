<p>CSS Solved a Big Problem
    HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!
    
    HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:
    
    <h1>This is a heading</h1>
    
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    
    When tags like front, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.
    
    To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.
    
    CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!</p>
<p style="margin-top: 40px;">Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.</p>
